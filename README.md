## Klipper config for Longer LK4 Pro

Note, My printer is not stock. If your printer is stock then it will need tweaking to work.

This is mainly here as a backup, you'll need to configure things like E-steps and also to PID tuning as detailed in the Klipper Docs.

Pressure advance value may work for you, I use it for PLA mainly, I'm using the bowden setup, however it varies per filament so tuning PA is also recommended.

Use at your own risk
